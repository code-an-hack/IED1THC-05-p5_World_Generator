**Steps**
1. Create a function that generates a grid of 50x50 cells. Each cell should be assigned a value with perlin noise. Visualize the grid by just coloring in grayscale the cells depending on their value.
2. Apply a radial gradient with controllable start and end to the cells' values. The visual output should resemble and island.
3. Load the images in the folder "textures". Assign a threshold value for each texture, place them on the cells instead of the grayscale coloring so that ranges determine texture by value.
4. Load additional images in the folder "assets". Place these randomly on the island. Each asset defines its placement value through a range. Also add size and density variables.
